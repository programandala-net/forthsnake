- Remove flickering: don't clear the screen; update only the head and
  the last segment of the snake.
- Increase speed after the length.
- Update the score (length) only when needed.
- Make rudder keys configurable.
- Improve the drawing of the border. Use string constants.
- Benchmark `." X"` vs ``'X' emit``.
- Change current speed using the keys of the current and opposite
  directions.
